7zip-and-p7zip
==============

For reasons I cannot fathom, the developer of 7zip and the porters/developers of p7zip do not maintain a public version control system with their source code. (I sure hope for their sanity they use one privately)

This repository contains a properly tagged and branched recent history of 7zip and p7zip source code to help with debugging and porting.

The master branch contains the 7zip code built from the downloadable archives at https://sourceforge.net/projects/sevenzip/

The p7zip branch contains the 7pzip code, branched of the corresponding ported version of 7zip and assembled from the  downloadable archives at https://sourceforge.net/projects/p7zip/

Each released version is tagged with vXXXX-7zip for 7zip versions and vXXXX-p7zip for p7zip versions.
